# nklang

A parser and interpreter for a selfmade programming language.

## But why?

Why not, it's fun.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/niklaskorz/nklang/cmd/nklg
```

Then, the interpreter can be used as `nklg some_file.nk` to run code from a file or `nklg` without any arguments to run the repl.
